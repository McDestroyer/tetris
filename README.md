Hello! I would like to inform you that the controls can be considered awkward. 
To read what they are or edit them to suit yourself, check the controls.txt file in the data folder.

I would also like to warn you that the music can be rather loud, so I recommend having your volume low but not 0.

Game Description:

We strived to make the game as close to identical as possible to the original, including adding various details like T-spins
and the exact same score system as the default games. The rotation system should be identical,
and leveling up increases the difficulty significantly.


Instructions:

To launch the game, run start.bat


I hope you have fun and enjoy our version of our game!
